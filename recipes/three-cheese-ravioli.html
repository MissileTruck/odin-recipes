    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack eggs in small bowl. Throw away shells and wash your hands.</li>
            <li>Measure 1 1/4 cup flour with accuracy. Spoon into measuring cups, use a flat edge to level. Do not overpack.</li>
            <li>Add flour, salt, oil, and eggs to large bowl. Stir with spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Gather into a ball.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, knead dough until smooth and elastic, 8-10 min.</li>
            <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make filling. Add ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan to small bowl. Stir and combine.</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 6 pieces. On a lightly floured surface roll 2 pieces into very thin rectangles, slightly larger than the mold.</li>
            <li>Set one piece of dough on top of mold, covering the zigzags. Use fingers to lightly press dough into holes.</li>
            <li>Add 1 level teaspoon cheese filling to each hole</li>
            <li>Set second piece of dough on top. Roll with rolling pin, pressing in all directions until zigzags are visible.</li>
            <li>Remove top of mold. Flip upside down and pop out ravioli. Repeat steps 7-11 twice to make 24 ravioli.</li>
            <li>Bring pot of slated water to boil. Cook ravioli 2-3 min, until floating. Drain in colander and serve with warm marinara. TASTE & SHARE!</li>
